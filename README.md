# Hardware-Security-Lab

## Project Overview
Investigated the Spectre attack exploiting CPU vulnerabilities like out-of-order execution and branch prediction. Implemented
FLUSH+RELOAD techniques to demonstrate how speculative execution can leak sensitive data through side-channel attacks. The
project highlighted the need for improved hardware security measures to prevent such exploits.
